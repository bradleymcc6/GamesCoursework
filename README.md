As my game was too large in size to be submitted to NESS, I have placed it here.
The aim of the game is to get past the enemies in the castle, and make it to the location where a bomb has been planted.
The player should then attempt to defuse the bomb, while ensuring any further spawning enemies are fended off.
Navigation is achieved using the W key to move, and the mouse to aim/look in a certain direction.
The game can be played on either Easy or Normal mode, and in the former the enemies take more damage per hit, and also have less accuracy.

The game also has a minigame whereby the player is up against an AI in a slightly modified version of TicTacToe in order to attempt to defuse a bomb.
